# Pubsy
Report Publication Automation Framework

The purpose of this application is to automate as much of the reporting process as 
possible.  Pubsy also lends itself to creating reports that define a certain set of
activities and attacks that take place on common services.  


Run the report_test_runbook.py to see the usage.

Accompanying the source is a .BAS VBScript file to run on the report, making it
easier to identify areas that need more attention.
